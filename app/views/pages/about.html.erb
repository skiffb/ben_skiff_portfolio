            <p>Hi! I'm Ben Skiff. I love to travel, enjoy nature, music, and sports. I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. I received a bachelor's degree in physics with a minor in mathematics from Washington & Jefferson College in 2016. I first discovered writing code during the course of my studies, and fell in love with it. After graduating, I began working in the electronics engineering industry where I realized that writing code could bring me a life full of more passion.</p>
            <p>After 1.5 years in the electronics engineering industry, I decided to take the dive into web development and attended the Le Wagon Ruby on Rails bootcamp in January 2018, in Bali Indonesia. There I received intensive training in web development with Ruby on Rails, and met some cool people and had some great experiences along the way. </p>
            <p class="mb-5">Following the bootcamp, I began with some freelance web application development before working full-time at Invoice Home as a remote employee for about 2 years. I gained great experience learning from the best, building web applications, as well as having the opportunity to learn and build beautiful mobile applications for both iOS and Android. Since then, I have been working as a freelancer. I have worked remotely on projects for clients and employers who are based in the USA, Europe, and Asia. No matter where you are in the world, I can build the application you need!</p>
